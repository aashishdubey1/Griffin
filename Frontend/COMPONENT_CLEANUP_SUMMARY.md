# Component Cleanup Summary

## Components Moved to Extra Demo Folder

The following unused components have been moved from the main `components/` folder to `Extra demo/components/` to keep the production codebase clean and organized:

### Moved Components:

1. **`components/auth/`** → **`Extra demo/components/auth/`**
   - `login-form.tsx` - Form component for authentication (unused in main app, which has dedicated auth pages)
   - `register-form.tsx` - Registration form component (unused in main app)

2. **`components/file-upload/`** → **`Extra demo/components/file-upload/`**
   - `drag-drop-zone.tsx` - File upload component (not used in current main app implementation)

3. **`components/griffin-interface.tsx`** → **`Extra demo/components/griffin-interface.tsx`**
   - Legacy Griffin interface component (only used in `Extra demo/griffin/page.tsx`)

### Updated Import Paths:

- Updated `Extra demo/griffin/page.tsx` to use relative import path for `griffin-interface.tsx`

### Remaining Active Components:

The following components remain in the main `components/` folder as they are actively used in the production application:

#### Main Landing Page Components:
- `navigation.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx and app/chat/page.tsx
- `hero-content.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `dashboard-showcase.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `pattern-overlay.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `badge-component.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `documentation-section.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `pricing-section.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `faq-section.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `cta-section.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx
- `footer-section.tsx` - Used in app/page.tsx

#### Functional Components:
- `chat/` - Chat interface components used in app/chat/page.tsx
- `code-review/` - Code review components used in app/chat/page.tsx
- `job-status/` - Job tracking components used in app/chat/page.tsx
- `ui/` - UI component library used throughout the application

### Benefits:

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Main components folder now only contains actively used components
2. **Better Organization**: Demo and test components are properly separated
3. **No Breaking Changes**: All main application functionality remains intact
4. **Maintained Demo Functionality**: All demo pages and components continue to work in the Extra demo folder
5. **Clear Separation**: Production vs demo/test code is clearly distinguished

### Verification:

- ✅ All main app pages compile without errors
- ✅ No broken imports in production code
- ✅ Demo components remain functional in Extra demo folder
- ✅ Import paths updated where necessary
