# Extra Demo & Unused Components

This folder contains demo, test, debug, and unused components that were moved from the main application structure to keep the production code clean.

## Structure

### `/components/`
**Demo & Test Components (moved from main app):**
- **auth-test.tsx** - Complete authentication flow test component
- **auth-flow-example.tsx** - Example component demonstrating authentication workflow  
- **debug-api.tsx** - API debugging tool for testing backend connections
- **demo-job-flow.tsx** - Job submission and status checking demo
- **test-job-flow.tsx** - Test component for job tracking functionality

**Unused Components (cleaned up):**
- **auth-guard.tsx** - Authentication guard component (not currently used)
- **effortless-integration-updated.tsx** - Integration showcase component (unused)
- **header.tsx** - Header component (not currently used)
- **review-results.tsx** - Duplicate review results component (main one is in code-review/)
- **testimonials-section.tsx** - Testimonials section (not currently used)
- **theme-provider.tsx** - Theme provider component (not currently used)
- **your-work-in-sync.tsx** - Sync section component (unused)

### `/pages/` (moved from main app)
- **auth-demo/** - Authentication demo page (`/auth-demo`)
- **auth-test/** - Authentication test page (`/auth-test`)
- **debug/** - Debug tools page (`/debug`)
- **demo/** - General demo page (`/demo`)
- **test-job/** - Job testing page (`/test-job`)

### Other Files
- **globals.css** - Duplicate CSS file (main one is in app/)

## Purpose

These components demonstrate:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Email-based login
   - Token storage in localStorage
   - Authenticated API requests

2. **Job Submission & Tracking**
   - Code review submission
   - Job status polling
   - Real-time status updates

3. **API Testing**
   - Backend connection testing
   - Error handling verification
   - Request/response debugging

## Usage

These components are for **development and testing purposes only**. They should NOT be included in production builds.

### To Use Demo Components:
Update import paths to point to the demo folder:

```typescript
// Old path (when in main components folder)
import { AuthTest } from "@/components/auth-test"

// New path (from demo folder)  
import { AuthTest } from "@/demo/components/auth-test"
```

### For Production Deployment:
Consider adding this folder to `.gitignore` or remove entirely:

```gitignore
# Demo and test components
/demo/
```

## Cleanup Summary

### Moved to Demo:
- 5 demo/test components that were cluttering the main components folder
- 5 unused components that had no imports/references  
- 7 unused components from previous cleanup
- 5 demo pages from the app directory
- 1 duplicate CSS file

### Removed:
- Empty `/styles` directory
- Duplicate package manager files (npm vs pnpm conflict)

### Result:
- ✅ Clean, focused production codebase
- ✅ Separated demo/test code from production code  
- ✅ Removed all unused files and duplicates
- ✅ Better project organization and maintainability
